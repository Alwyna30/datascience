- **KNN.ipynb**  
  K-Nearest Neighbors classification and regression.

- **LGBM & XGBM.ipynb - Colab.html**  
  Gradient boosting with LightGBM and XGBoost (Google Colab export).

- **LOGISTICREGRESSION (1).ipynb**  
  Logistic regression for binary classification.

- **Naive Bayes & Text Mining.ipynb**  
  Naive Bayes classifier and text mining techniques.

- **NEURAL NETWORKS.ipynb**  
  Introduction to neural networks and deep learning.

- **PCA.ipynb**  
  Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction.

- **Random Forest.ipynb**  
  Random Forest ensemble methods.

- **Recommendation_System.ipynb**  
  Building recommendation systems (collaborative and content-based).

  Support Vector Machines for classification.

- **TimeSeries.ipynb**  
  Time series analysis and forecasting.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Open notebooks:**  
   Use [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to open and run the `.ipynb` files.

3. **Install dependencies:**  
   Most notebooks use popular Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`. Install them using:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(Create a `requirements.txt` if needed.)*

## Notes

- The `LGBM & XGBM.ipynb - Colab.html` file is an exported HTML from Google Colab. For best experience, use the original notebook in Colab.
- Each notebook is self-contained and includes explanations, code, and outputs.
